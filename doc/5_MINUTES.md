[Legalese is hard to understand](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/l099fe/why_are_legal_documents_hard_to_understand_for_a/) for those unfamiliar with it.

In fact, many even argue [legal jargon is a language unto itself](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/95218/is-legalese-a-thing-in-languages-other-than-english).

[Yuho](https://github.com/gongahkia/yuho) makes reading legalese easier to understand by reformatting and standardising the [informal logic of the law](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-informal/) into the [formal logic of mathematics and computer science](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/).

> FUA add more here later once details about Yuho v3.0 have been firmed up and implementation has been included. Refer to [this document](https://github.com/gongahkia/yuho/blob/main/archive/yuho_v2/doc/yuho_onboarding.md) as needed.
