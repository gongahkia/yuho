# Future plans

## 030824

### Follow Up Actions

#### Immediate 

* Rethink Yuho's syntax to be more robust
* Start from the `./examples/sampleCheating.yh` and rework how Yuho is representing the statute of cheatingA
    * Rename the syntax from `struct` to sthing like `container`? the term `struct` itself might be too intimidating for lawyers and law students
    * Incorporate conditional logic (like OR) into definition attribute of the struct, punishment etc. 
        * Definition shouldn't just be a damn string! Otherwise the logic still needs to be mentally evaluated by the lawyer / law student.
        * What other fields can I break up and specify logic within?
        * What other elements of a statute can I break up and specify logic within?
        * How else can I break down the logic of a statute to be **even more** granular?
            * Mental element and Physical element
            * Mens reus and Actus reus
    * Make tokenisation stronger.
* Rescope entire project based on accurately representing a single provision for Cheating from S415 A

#### Later

1. Checks under `./test`
    * right now only checking for syntax and enforcing basic conditional constructs
    * add files to dynamically generate tests for different statutes
    * integrate LLMs that are fed sanitised struct to see whether Yuho's internal logic and struct validity can be 'tested'
        * consider whether to use encoder/decoder or transformer model, see other avail options

2. Appealing UI/UX
    * intuitive controls so lawyers and law students *(no programming proficiency required)*
    * "right now you're showing how the sausage is made *(the nerdy programmer shit)*"
    * pitching Yuho to lawyers requires an easy to **access** and **use** frontend interface
    * ideas
        * scratch-like controls with drag and drop interface so different logical blocks can be rearranged and the struct updates live
        * live editor for Yuho code that updates the mermaid diagram
        * is there a HTML element / Svelte frontend that can achieve the same flow-chart like Display without relying on Mermaid? *(ideally I would want HMR)*
        * retain the flowchart-style display to show all logical outcomes of a given offence as defined by the statute
        * add user input method that allows 'stepping-through' the flowchart for a given charge / **highlight** the logical path for A --> B, useful especially if the flowchart is very complex and nested

3. Comprehensive 
    * find edgecases Prof Alexandar Woon was talking about within the Penal Code *(generated by the amendments or not)*

4. Rework the following files per the new changes
    * `./README.md` for updates to Yuho's usage and status under > [IMPORTANT!]
    * `./doc/syntax.md` for updates to Yuho's syntax
    * `./example/sample*.yh` for updates to all Yuho example files with the updated syntax
    * `./grammer/` for updates to all files regarding Yuho's new grammer and syntax
    * `./src/main/` for updates to all files recursively *(`-r`)* within all folders in `./src` regarding changes to Yuho's syntax
    * `./src/seconday/` for updates to all Yuho transpilers for Yuho's new syntax
    * `./web/src` for updates to all files like `trans_*.py` regrading transpilation to Yuho's new syntax
    * `./web/dep/*` for updates to all files recursively within all folders in `./web/dep` regarding chanegs to Yuho's validated examples of how Yuho code is meant to look
    * `./web/front/index.html` for updates to the transpiled HTML frontend code

### Feedback

* Prof Alexander Woon
    * Yuho presupposes a consistent structure across the whole penal code, which might be a misplaced assumption
    * Penal Code 1871 but many amendments have since been made, creating inconsistencies within the format of how the whole Penal Code is structured
    * Cheating provision in particular is very complicated
    * How can you more robustly represent the Penal Code?

* Eugene
    * L4 focuses on so many areas that their language design has to account for too many things 
    * Advantage is that Yuho can afford to be **more granular** in it's representation of even one statute, so focus on that first
    * How deep can Yuho go in representing statutes that can differentiate Yuho from other DSLs? 

* Lucas
    * Don't be discouraged
