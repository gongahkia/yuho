# Welcome to Yuho

**Yuho** is a domain-specific language (DSL) dedicated to simplifying [legalese](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legalese) by providing a programmatic representation of Singapore Law.

## What is Yuho?

Yuho helps law students and legal professionals better understand statutes by providing a flexible, programmatic syntax for representing legal concepts. Current applications focus on Singapore Criminal Law, but the principles can be applied to any jurisdiction that relies on statutes.

## Key Features

- **üéØ Domain-Specific**: Tailored specifically for legal reasoning and statute representation
- **üìä Visual Diagrams**: Transpile to Mermaid flowcharts and mindmaps
- **‚úÖ Formal Verification**: Generate Alloy specifications for logical verification
- **üîç Type-Safe**: Strong, static typing ensures correctness
- **üöÄ CLI Tools**: Comprehensive command-line interface for all operations
- **üìù REPL**: Interactive shell for experimentation

## Why Yuho?

The law is innately complex. [Statutes](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/) are not always easy to understand, especially for incoming law students new to legalese and its logical structure.

Yuho provides:

1. **Clarity**: Make statutory logic explicit and visual
2. **Verification**: Ensure logical consistency through formal methods
3. **Education**: Help students understand legal reasoning patterns
4. **Modularity**: Reusable legal concepts and patterns

## Quick Example

```yh
// Define the legal concept of Cheating
struct Cheating {
    string accused,
    string victim,
    bool deception,
    bool dishonest,
    bool harm
}

// Define the logical requirements
match {
    case deception && dishonest && harm := consequence "guilty of cheating";
    case _ := consequence "not guilty";
}
```

This code can then be:

- ‚úÖ **Validated** for syntax and semantic correctness
- üìä **Visualized** as flowcharts or mindmaps
- üîç **Verified** using formal methods with Alloy
