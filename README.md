Yuho is a domain-specific language dedicated to simplifying [legalese](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legalese) by providing a programmatic representation of Singapore Law.  

Current applications are focused on Singapore Criminal Law but really can be applied to any jurisdiction that relies on [statutes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statute).

## Rationale

The law is innately complex.  

[Statutes](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/) are not always easy to understand, especially for incoming law students new to [legalese](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legalese) and its [logical structure](https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ILEI-Forms-of-Legal-Reasoning-2014.pdf).  

Criminal Law is often a [foundational module](https://law.smu.edu.sg/programmes/core-courses-description) most students take in their first year of law school. In particular, Singapore Criminal Law is nearly entirely statute-based, largely focusing on the [Penal Code](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871).

Yuho is a DSL that seeks to *help law students* better understand statutes by providing a flexible syntax which affords a programmatic representation of Singapore Criminal Law. By allowing users to decide how to represent stautory provisions in `.yh` code, the hope is that the statute's key elements and its underlying conditional relationships surface themselves. These representations can be coarse or granular, entirely scoped by their use-cases.  

Getting into the specifics, Yuho provides the following four products.

1. [Yuho](./doc/SYNTAX.md), a DSL made to be readable and codeable by law students and lawyers
2. [Formalised semantic](./test/) for legal reasoning modelled after the syntactical patterns of the law
3. [CLI tool](./src/cli/) for interacting with Yuho's primary functions in the CLI
4. [Transpiler](./src/transpiler/) that transpiles to the below targets

### Output formats

| Target | Usage |   
| :--- | :--- |  
| Mermaid | Diagrammatic representations of statutory logic *(mindmap, flowchart)* | 
| Alloy | Semantic and logical verification |

## Nerd stuff

For those interested, Yuho provides a [grammatically-validated](https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/courses/F19SI413/lec/l07/lec.html) syntax core that splays out all requirements and consequences for a given offence, providing assurance of logical correctness from the get-go. Yuho was also designed to be [exception-validated](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/y6663u/difference_between_input_validation_and_exception/) and [language-agnostic](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/28484/what-is-language-agnosticism-and-why-is-it-called-that), transpiling from one formally-specified source of truth to multiple target outputs, encouraging the development of tools that leverage off Yuho's logical core.
