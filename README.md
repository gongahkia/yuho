Yuho takes inspiration from the following projects.

* [Natural L4](https://github.com/smucclaw/dsl): Language with an English-like syntax that transpiles to multiple targets, focused on codification of contracts and Singapore Contract Law.
* [Blawx](https://github.com/Lexpedite/blawx): User-friendly web-based tool for Rules as Code, a declarative logic knowledge representation tool for encoding, testing and using rules.
* [Morphir](https://github.com/finos/morphir): Technology agnostic toolkit for digitisation of business models and their underlying decision logic, enabling automation in fintech.
