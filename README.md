### Analogues

Yuho takes much inspiration from the following projects.

* [Catala](https://github.com/CatalaLang): Language syntax that explicitly mimicks logical structure of the Law, focused on general Socio-fiscal legislature in most jurisidictions.
* [Natural L4](https://github.com/smucclaw/dsl): Language with an English-like syntax that transpiles to multiple targets, focused on codification of contracts and Singapore Contract Law.

### Research

* [A Logic for Statutes](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3088206)
