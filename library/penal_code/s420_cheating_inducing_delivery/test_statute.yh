/*
Test cases for S420 Cheating and Dishonestly Inducing Delivery

Tests verify aggravated offense elements:
    1. Base cheating (S415) established
    2. Dishonest deception
    3. Specific inducement (deliver/make/alter/destroy)
    4. Delivery or action occurred
    5. Communication method (remote = further aggravated)
