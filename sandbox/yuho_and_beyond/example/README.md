# Example Yuho files v3.0

Brainstorming for possible v3.0 syntax.

## Follow up actions

1. Work out fresh syntax for Yuho v3 first
2. Consider representing each duty of care test in yh
3. Get a working interpreter and transpiler working in python
4. Returns a float of duty of care
5. Transpiles to mermaid and other diagrammatic representations
6. Must cover logical gaps as Meng has mentioned
7. Also cover criminal law and see the React app Meng showed me [here](https://github.com/smucclaw/sandbox/blob/default/mengwong/layman/src/woon.ts#L552C1-L578C6)
