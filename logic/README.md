# Logic evaluation 

* Boolean minimization in `prop_eval.py`

## Usage

```console
$ python3 learn.py
```

## Rationale
  
There are many benefits to implementing a logic engine capable of heuristic and boolean minimization.  
  
By substituting truth values with statutory elements, complex statements evaluate to less complex ones.   
  
### Examples

> [!WARNING]
> Continue formatting and logicising the below examples to make sure readable

> [!WARNING]
> Continue adding examples below showing logical fallacies and other contradictions

> [!WARNING]
> Make every evaluated statement as atomic as possible, so should propositional formulas should evaluate to basic truth statements
